# @fizz/EXPERt

An application designed to support running web browser-based scientific experiments.

**Note**: EXPERt was initially created primarily to support a research project undertaken by an individual graduate student. Though it was later extended with additional features to support unrelated experiments, it should by no means be considered a "production-quality" software package. Which is to say, it is entirely incomplete, rough around the edges, and likely contains many design flaws, not to mention bugs. On the other hand, if you treat it kindly and set your expectations accordingly, it might do what you want. Proceed entirely at your own risk, caveat emptor, and may the Force be with you.
